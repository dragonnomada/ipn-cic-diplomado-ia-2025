      "WASHINGTON — Stellar pitching kept the Mets afloat in the first half of last season despite their offensive woes. But they cannot produce an encore of their pennant-winning season if their lineup keeps floundering while their pitching is nicked, bruised and stretched thin.\n",
      "“We were going to ride our pitching,” Manager Terry Collins said before Wednesday’s game. “But we’re not riding it right now. We’ve got as many problems with our pitching as we do anything.”\n",
      "Wednesday’s 4-2 loss to the Washington Nationals was cruel for the already-limping Mets. Pitching in Steven Matz’s place, the spot starter Logan Verrett allowed two runs over five innings. But even that was too large a deficit for the Mets’ lineup to overcome against Max Scherzer, the Nationals’ starter.\n",
      "“We’re not even giving ourselves chances,” Collins said, adding later, “We just can’t give our pitchers any room to work.”\n",
      "The Mets did not score until the ninth inning, when a last-gasp two-run homer by James Loney off Nationals reliever Shawn Kelley snapped a streak of 23 scoreless innings for the team.\n",
      "The Mets were swept in the three-game series and fell six games behind the Nationals in the National League East. Of late, the Mets have looked worse than their 40-37 record.\n",
      "“I don’t think we’ve played half our games yet this year,” right fielder Curtis Granderson said. “There’s still a lot of things left that can and hopefully will happen.”\n",
      "Scherzer toyed with the Mets, who were initially without Granderson after he was scratched from the lineup with lingering calf tightness. Even though Granderson has been inconsistent this season, he had hit well against Scherzer in the past. Alejandro De Aza, who entered the game with a .165 average, started in right field instead because Collins said the team had few options.\n",
      "After Scherzer gave up a single to Asdrubal Cabrera and walked Loney in the second inning, he retired the next 18 batters, until an eighth-inning single by Brandon Nimmo.\n",
      "The Mets struggled again with runners on base. After Nimmo and the pinch-hitting Granderson singled in the eighth, pinch-hitter Travis d’Arnaud grounded out, and De Aza struck out.\n",
      "“If they keep adding pressure on themselves, they’re going to continue to struggle,” Collins said. “That’s one of the things we try to make sure they have to understand: They have to be themselves.”\n",
      "General Manager Sandy Alderson, Collins and the coaching staff have met about the offense and discussed the odd dynamics: Some players are performing at or better than their career averages, but the lineup as a whole has struggled immensely, especially with runners in scoring position.\n",
      "“We’re just not driving in any runs,” Collins said. “That’s been the frustrating part. It’s not that we’re striking out. We’re popping up, or a double-play ball.”\n",
      "The Mets have a power-hitting team, so asking players to bunt or hit and run would go against their strengths.\n",
      "“When you start to change a team that’s built one way and start to make them do something different, you’re going to get your butt beat,” Collins said.\n",
      "Earlier in the season, the Mets appeared like an all-or-nothing, home-run-driven team. Although they hit only .211 as a team in May, they smashed 40 home runs. They have a higher average in June, but they have hit only 24 homers, and the inconsistent offense has put a strain on the pitching staff.\n",
      "In the second inning, Verrett gave up a solo home run to the ex-Met Daniel Murphy. Collins wanted to limit the workloads of Addison Reed and Jeurys Familia, so he turned to reliever Sean Gilmartin in the eighth. Gilmartin gave up a two-run homer to Murphy, who has hit .429 (15 for 35) with four home runs against the Mets this season, his first since leaving the team.\n",
      "“I felt like I kept us in the game and gave us a chance to come back and win it,” Verrett said. “I wish that I wouldn’t have given up the two runs.”\n",
      "Verrett was put in this position because of the effects of bone spurs on the Mets’ rotation. The team asked Verrett to start Wednesday and gave Matz an extra day of rest after he received anti-inflammatory medication for the large bone spur in his left elbow. He will try to pitch through it.\n",
      "Noah Syndergaard has a smaller and less intrusive bone spur in the back of his right elbow.\n",
      "“As long as I’m staying on my anti-inflammatories and my mechanics are on point, I’m able to go out there every five days and compete,” Syndergaard said.\n",
      "For the Mets, the immediate road ahead will be even tougher. Matz was expected to pitch Thursday against the Chicago Cubs, one of the best teams in baseball this season.\n",

       "'PALOS VERDES ESTATES, Calif. — From high atop the oceanside cliffs, the shimmering blue-green water of Lunada Bay appears to be a surfer’s dream.\\nBut by the time surfers put on their wet suits, some may be having second thoughts. There are the taunts, and the peltings of dirt and rocks they may face as they climb down the hill.\\nAnd if they make it into the water, they risk confrontation with a band of residents, known widely as the Bay Boys, who have long been accused of zealously — and sometimes violently — claiming the epic waves here as their exclusive territory.\\n“The last time I surfed out there, these guys tried to really hurt me,” said Chris Taloa, 42, who for years lived in nearby Redondo Beach. “A guy tried to ram a board into my ribs.”\\nBut after intimidation that has kept outsiders like Mr. Taloa away for generations, a group of surfers is fighting to open up the beach to all comers. A class-action lawsuit filed last month by the Coastal Protection Rangers and two surfers seeks to bar the Bay Boys from congregating at Lunada Bay — similar to the way injunctions have been used against members of criminal street gangs.\\nThe alleged members hail from one of the most exclusive communities in Southern California; many of them are middle-aged; some live in multimillion-dollar homes so close to the coastline here that the morning fog rolling off the ocean leaves their lawns damp.\\nStill, Vic Otten, one of the lawyers for those bringing the lawsuit, said the group represented a threat to the public. Only eight members have been named in the lawsuit so far, but he said he expected to add dozens more.\\n“They’ve taken a public asset, the ocean, and stolen it through violence and intimidation,” he said. “In California, the ocean belongs to the public, not to a bunch of trust-fund babies.”\\nOutside his auto shop, where surfboards were leaning against the wall, Angelo Ferrara, who, along with several of his family members, was named in the lawsuit, said that his family was not part of any gang, and that the territorialism here was no worse than anywhere else.\\n“Surfing is overcrowded,” Mr. Ferrara, 58, said. “You have beginners, intermediate and advanced. And they don’t get along.”\\nFrank Ponce, a Palos Verdes resident and surfer, scoffed at the idea of an organized gang, saying the problem was merely “a couple bad apples,” and visitors who were not experienced enough to surf a wave as powerful as those at Lunada Bay.\\n“You get all these people from out of town who think they’re big-wave surfers, and then they cut people off,” Mr. Ponce said. “Of course they’re going to get yelled at — they’re endangering lives.”\\nSurfing “localism,” with a hierarchy in the water based on skill and seniority, is hardly exclusive to this beach: It can be found at choice breaks from here to Australia. And many surfers see its benefits, especially in spots with big waves that are dangerous for beginners.\\nAs surfing’s popularity has exploded in recent years, localism has faded as more people have charged the waves.\\nBut not at Lunada Bay, which offers not only some of the most powerful waves in Southern California, but also an easily defensible location. At the edge of the Palos Verdes Peninsula south of Los Angeles, it is a long drive from most population centers; the steep path down from the cliffs to the ocean is treacherous even when nothing is being thrown at you; and the police department in this town — where the median family income is more than $170,000 and Porsches are a common sight — has long been accused of tacitly supporting the Bay Boys’ local-only ethos, as a strategy for keeping away crowds.\\nMr. Taloa grew up surfing on the north shore of Oahu, in Hawaii, an area famous for its huge waves — and for locals who will use their fists to enforce their hierarchy in the water. But Mr. Taloa said he had never faced anything like what goes on in Lunada Bay, where the harassment began before he even reached the water.\\n“In most places, if you come out in the lineup, wait your turn, give respect, they’ll give you a chance, but these guys don’t even do that,” he said. In Lunada, he said, “I’ve been threatened with jail and rape, racial language.”\\nDiana Milena Reed, an aspiring big-wave surfer who lives in Malibu, said she was sexually harassed in February while watching a friend surf from a stone patio that local surfers constructed decades ago on the nearby rocks — without approval from the state. She said a middle-aged man sprayed beer on her, made an array of sexual comments, and briefly exposed himself, all while several others looked on.\\n“There aren’t usually a lot of women out there,” Ms. Reed, 29, said. “That’s intimidating enough, without having men harass you.”\\nMs. Reed is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, which also seeks to compel the city to crack down. Past pledges to stamp out the group were quickly abandoned. Little changed here after a brawl on the beach in 1995, surfers said. And in 2002, when the police chief installed a camera to record Lunada Bay full time, the City Council soon ordered it removed, after residents complained that it would draw untold masses to the area after they got a peek at Palos Verdes’s natural splendor.\\n“Palos Verdes would like nothing better than to have gates at either end of the peninsula, and not let any of us up there,” said Matt Warshaw, who edits the Encyclopedia of Surfing website. Even growing up in nearby Manhattan Beach in the 1970s, he said, he knew that going to Palos Verdes would mean trouble.\\nAfter the release of an undercover video last summer — which was produced by The Guardian and showed middle-aged men harassing would-be surfers, and the police doing little in response to a complaint — the police chief, Jeff Kepley, vowed to end localism.\\nIn a brief telephone interview, Chief Kepley said he could not discuss the issue because of the lawsuit, but added: “We’ve done a lot. All anyone says is that we don’t do anything.”\\nStill, reports of harassment have continued. And most outsiders continue to stay away. On a recent day with a big swell, only three men were in the water at Lunada Bay, catching wave after majestic wave. A few others watched from the stone porch, where beer, snacks and surf equipment were stashed.\\n“Nobody goes there, because the reputation is so well known throughout the surf world,” said Steve Hawk, a Southern California native and the former editor of Surfer Magazine. “They’ve kind of succeeded.”'"

       "  'Mayor Bill de Blasio’s counsel and chief legal adviser, Maya Wiley, is resigning next month from her City Hall position to become the chairwoman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, New York City’s independent oversight agency for the Police Department.\\nThe move represents the latest shake-up for the de Blasio administration amid continuing state and federal investigations into the mayor’s fund-raising, and fills a two-month vacancy at the police review board created by the resignation of its chairman, Richard D. Emery, in April.\\nA civil rights lawyer and advocate for racial and social justice, Ms. Wiley joined the de Blasio administration in early 2014 to focus on legal issues as well as on the mayor’s efforts to address issues of inequality. But over time, Ms. Wiley became discouraged over not being part of Mr. de Blasio’s inner circle and felt cut out of both legal questions and advocacy, according to a person familiar with her thinking. On the former, Mr. de Blasio often relied instead on the city’s corporation counsel and Henry Berger, the mayor’s special counsel; on the latter, he favored his top political aides. The person requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.\\nMore recently, Ms. Wiley was assigned to help craft the administration’s legal response to the state and federal inquiries as well as to requests for the public disclosure of documents, notably emails between Mr. de Blasio and trusted advisers outside the administration.\\nIt was in response to a question from reporters about the withholding of those emails with advisers that Ms. Wiley, defending the practice, described the advisers as “agents of the city” — a designation that appeared novel and resulted in days of unfavorable press coverage.\\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio thanked Ms. Wiley for her service and congratulated her on her new role.\\nThe review board investigates allegations of misconduct by officers and makes recommendations for discipline to the Police Department. Its data on the number of complaints, and its investigations of officers, provide an important barometer of police behavior and a politically important one for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who campaigned on improving police-community relations.\\nMr. Wiley will also take a position at the New School in Manhattan. Her moves were reported by The Wall Street Journal.\\nThe announcement of Ms. Wiley’s departure from City Hall followed that of a recently hired director of social media, Scott Kleinberg, who resigned on Saturday, just eight weeks after being hired to bring greater personality to the Twitter, Facebook and other online accounts associated with the mayor’s office. His resignation was reported by DNA Info.\\nIn a Facebook post that was later removed, Mr. Kleinberg complained of long hours and micromanagement and described his experience with the administration as working with “political hacks plus a boss who just couldn’t get it,” adding, “It was a bad combination for sure.” Mr. Kleinberg declined to comment.\\nThe departures came less than two months after Karen Hinton, the mayor’s top spokeswoman, announced her resignation from the administration.

       "  'In the early morning hours of Labor Day last year, a group of gunmen from the 8-Trey street gang made their way through a crowd of revelers gathered near a Brooklyn public housing project to celebrate J’ouvert, a pre-dawn party that precedes the annual West Indian American Day Parade. The housing project was “enemy territory,” the authorities said, the stronghold of a rival gang, the Folk Nation.\\nAs hundreds of people drank and danced in costume, the warring factions spotted each other, and a gunfight broke out in the darkness. Caught in the crossfire was an up-and-coming lawyer in the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Carey Gabay, who was at the festivities with his brother. Mr. Gabay, 43, who was of Jamaican heritage, died a week later from his wounds.\\nFor some in government and law enforcement circles, the death of Mr. Gabay, who had risen from a childhood in Bronx public housing to Harvard Law School and then to public service, was emblematic of the havoc that street gangs have inflicted on New York City residents.\\nOn Wednesday, as part of a continuing investigation, the authorities announced that three men had been indicted in the killing.\\nOne of the men, Micah Alleyne, 24, was already in custody, having been indicted last month. The other two — Tyshawn Crawford, 21, and Keith Luncheon, 24 — were named along with Mr. Alleyne in a new indictment on Wednesday, which holds all three equally responsible for Mr. Gabay’s murder. Each of the men is charged with second-degree murder.\\n“These defendants are charged with creating a killing field in a crowd of innocent people, showing depraved indifference to human life and causing the death of Carey Gabay,” Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, said in a statement about the case.\\nAt a news conference at his office, Mr. Thompson said that 20 gang members, armed with as many as 27 guns, had taken part in the gunfight in which dozens of shots were fired. He promised to seek indictments against the others involved in the episode. “This is just the beginning,” he said.\\nAt the time of his death, Mr. Gabay was first deputy counsel for the Empire State Development Corporation and lived with his wife in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn. He was shot in the head while trying to escape the gunfire by ducking between two cars in a parking lot at the Ebbets Field Houses on Bedford Avenue in Crown Heights.\\nThe housing complex had long been Folk Nation turf, Mr. Thompson said, and several of the gang’s members were among the crowd on an outdoor patio there during the J’ouvert celebration. Most of the shots fired that morning came from the direction of the patio, Mr. Thompson added. Members of both the Folk Nation and the 8-Treys had standing orders, he said, to open fire at each other on sight.\\n“When these two gangs see each other,” Mr. Thompson said, “there is no talking, just shooting.”\\nSurveillance-camera footage taken that morning, which Mr. Thompson played at the news conference, showed people frantically fleeing the patio and scurrying for cover as shots rang out. Investigators also discovered footage that Mr. Thompson said shows Mr. Alleyne firing a gun into the crowd, then running into a building at the Ebbets Field Houses.\\nMr. Alleyne, who was living in a homeless shelter in Jamaica, Queens, when he was arrested in May, was a Folk Nation member, Mr. Thompson said. He added that Mr. Crawford, who lives in East New York, belonged to the Hoodstarz gang, which is allied with the Folk Nation. Mr. Thompson described Mr. Luncheon, who lives in Crown Heights, as a member of the 8-Trey gang, a faction of the Crips.\\nA fourth defendant, Stanley Elianor, 25, was indicted in October on weapons charges in connection with Mr. Gabay’s murder for carrying a MAC-10 machine pistol during the melee.\\nPolice Commissioner William J. Bratton, appearing with Mr. Thompson at the news conference, said his department was targeting street gangs across the city, adding that officers had arrested gang members in three separate operations in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. Mr. Bratton also said that this year, for the first time, J’ouvert organizers would have to secure a permit for their event, which has traditionally taken place without official city approval. The police, the commissioner said, would increase their presence at the festivities in September to ensure there was no violence.\\n“If so much as a sneeze is made by these gangs in the run-up to the festival, we will be there,” Mr. Bratton said, “and not to say, ‘gesundheit.’ ”'),\n",

       "  'It was the Apple Store in New York City before there was such a thing as an Apple Store.\\nBefore iPods and iPads and iPhones, before Apple started selling and servicing its devices out of a glass cube on Fifth Avenue, the eclectic Tekserve store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan was where customers went for upgrades to their PowerBook laptops or to have their computers fixed.\\nBut times have changed, Tekserve’s managers said, and on Wednesday, they announced that the company was closing its retail and customer-service operation. The service center will remain open until July 31, and the retail store will close on Aug. 15. About 70 employees will lose their jobs, the company said.\\n“This is a cultural shift,” the company’s chief executive, Jerry Gepner, said in an interview in his office above the store. “It’s not a failure of the business. It’s like this giant wave finally crashed down upon us.”\\nTekserve found its niche in an era when Apple had a much smaller slice of the computer market. Among many of Tekserve’s customers then, Apple computers had a devoted following. “It was the cult of Mac,” said Mr. Gepner, who, before running Tekserve, was a regular customer.\\nHe said that customers had gravitated to Tekserve to buy Apple computers, have them serviced or have questions about them answered at a time when computers were more cumbersome to use and help was not simply a Google search away. “It was also a gathering place,” Mr. Gepner said, “where knowledge was shared.”\\nTekserve opened in 1987, focusing exclusively on repairs at first, and has always operated out of spaces on 23rd Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. More than 15 years ago, it moved into its current home, with 10,000 square feet of retail and service space, and grew into something of a New York City fixture. On “Sex and the City,” for instance, when Carrie Bradshaw’s laptop crashed, she rushed to Tekserve.\\nWhile Apple’s own stores are sleek and modern in appearance, Tekserve had the feel of a throwback, its shelves lined with old-fashioned radios and a soda machine where customers could grab a chilled Coca-Cola in a glass bottle. There was also a “museum” of Apple computers, with models dating back more than three decades, including a Macintosh 128K — the original Apple Macintosh personal computer — signed by Stephen Wozniak, the company’s co-founder.\\nThese days, though, Apple has six stores in Manhattan, including one in Chelsea, not far from Tekserve. There is also a Best Buy store just on the other side of Sixth Avenue from Tekserve. And then there are the options online.\\nResellers like Tekserve, once among the few places where customers could get Apple products, have been the victims of the technology company’s growth. But also, Tekserve said in a statement, swiftly rising rent has not helped.\\nMr. Gepner said that when he joined Tekserve in 2014, the owners asked him to see whether the diminishing retail operation could be saved. But, he said, the owners realized that a turnaround seemed unlikely. “For us,” he said, “the trend wasn’t going to reverse.”\\nTalk of the store’s closing had circulated for weeks among neighbors and regular customers. Employees were officially told on Wednesday that the end was imminent.\\n“We love our customers, and we love what we do,” Mr. Gepner said. “But there comes a point where that doesn’t make sense anymore, as much as we love it.”\\nThe company will continue with its corporate sales and professional services, as well as with an operation focused on small- and medium-size businesses, an area that has experienced growth, Mr. Gepner said.\\nOutside the store on Wednesday afternoon, word had not yet reached many customers, who said they were disappointed. Alan Wolk said he had been coming to Tekserve for about 15 years, including once to repair a keyboard damaged by spilled coffee.\\n“It’s been here forever,” he said. “These guys, they know their stuff. You can trust them.”\\nKerry Elson said she first came to Tekserve about a decade ago, when she was still working as an intern and trying to figure out how to use a new computer. She kept coming because she trusted those who worked there.\\n“I feel like this is my go-to,” she said. “It seemed like they were on your side.”'),\n",

       "  'OMAHA — The United States Olympic swimming trials are the spectacle that Michael Phelps built. If he had not strapped the sport to his broad back and climbed to the Olympic summit six times in Athens in 2004 and eight times in eight nights in Beijing in 2008, there would be no pre-finals light show at CenturyLink Center, no ticket scalpers. The crowds would be far smaller than 14,000, and fewer athletes would be extending their careers past college with the help of corporate endorsements.\\nAnd there would have been at least one fewer entrant in the 200-meter butterfly.\\nPhelps’s influence on the sport he set out to make more prominent, more professional, goes well beyond the eyeballs and the excitement he has brought to swimming since he appeared in his first United States trials, a much more subdued affair in Indianapolis in 2000. Phelps has inspired a generation to swim, including a few world-caliber athletes who crafted competitive schedules in Phelps’s image.\\nNobody was Phelps’s equal in the 200-meter butterfly final on Wednesday. He qualified for his fifth Olympic team by winning in 1 minute 54.84 seconds, ahead of Tom Shields (1:55.81). Those in his wake included Chase Kalisz, 22, who finished fifth, having already earned a berth to the Rio Games with a victory in the 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.\\nKalisz’s best leg in the I.M. is the breaststroke, and he could probably be world-class in that stroke’s events if he put his mind (and his training) to it. But Kalisz grew up in the Baltimore suburbs, and his second home was Meadowbrook Aquatic & Fitness Center, which Phelps had made famous as the most illustrious in a long line of star swimmers produced by North Baltimore Aquatic Club.\\nKalisz wanted to be like Mike, so he made himself into a world-class butterfly swimmer. “Me doing butterfly is a testament to me wanting to swim the same event as Michael,” Kalisz said. “Butterfly didn’t come natural to me.”\\nHe added: “Butterfly was something I had to work at, and I just loved racing next to Michael, and I did that enough that ultimately I would say the 200 butterfly is probably my second-best event. So I think me just wanting to emulate Michael so much is why my 2 fly is the way it is.”\\nThe Phelps effect knows no geographical boundaries. At the 2012 Olympics, the South African Chad Le Clos swam the same four individual events as Phelps (the 100 and 200 butterfly and the 200 and 400 I.M.). After handing Phelps his first international defeat in 10 years in the 200 butterfly, Le Clos explained that he had added more events to his program, including the one that gave him a gold medal, after watching Phelps win a record eight golds in Beijing.\\n“He was the reason I swam the butterfly,” Le Clos said. “It’s not a joke.”\\nHe added: “That’s why I swim the 200 freestyle, both the I.M.s. I don’t swim it for any other reason than just because Michael does.”\\nLe Clos took it personally when Phelps said last year that the men’s butterfly times around the world had been slow after the London Games, a factor that nudged Phelps out of retirement. After winning the 100 butterfly in 50.56 seconds at last summer’s world championships in Russia — a competition from which Phelps was absent — Le Clos crowed that his idol could “keep quiet now.”\\nPhelps, who competed at the United States senior nationals last summer after being removed from the American squad for the world championships following a drunken-driving arrest, responded hours later with a 50.45 to win the 100 butterfly.\\n“Chad liked me, and then he didn’t like me,” Phelps said recently with a laugh. “He said I was his hero, and then he was calling me out.”\\nIn the winter of his career, Phelps finds himself in a position similar to that of Tiger Woods: The children he inspired have grown up to provide some of his fiercest competition.\\nAt the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships in Australia, Daiya Seto of Japan shyly approached Phelps and showed him a photograph, taken at the 2001 edition of the meet in Japan. It was of a 7-year-old Seto, now one of the top individual medley swimmers in the world, posing with Phelps. “It was unbelievable,” Phelps said. “It’s insane.”\\nThe Australian Mitch Larkin had not yet become a worldbeater in the backstroke events when he had a memorable encounter with Phelps. It was in 2012, at an Olympic tuneup meet in the United States. Larkin said he had been walking on the pool deck after racing in the 200 I.M. when Phelps called him by name, praised his effort and said, “Keep doing what you’re doing.”\\nLarkin said, “That was a massive moment for me.”\\nHe said he had called his parents back in Australia, the time difference be damned, to tell them about the encouragement. “It just brings tears to my eyes remembering how excited Mitch was,” said Larkin’s mother, Judy. “It was a lovely moment for him that he’ll always treasure.”\\nFour years later, Larkin, 22, is the reigning world champion and the world No. 1 in the 100 and 200 backstrokes. Phelps’s magnanimous gesture, however indirectly, could end up spelling the end to the United States’ dominance in the stroke. The American men have won the last five Olympic gold medals awarded in the backstroke events.\\nThe loss to Le Clos notwithstanding, Phelps has owned the 200 butterfly since placing fifth in the event at the 2000 Olympics at age 15. He has held the world record continuously since 2001, lowering it by 3.41 seconds in that span, to 1:51.51.\\nBetween 2007 and 2009, his peak performance years, Phelps posted the four fastest times in history in the event. His 1:52.94 at last summer’s senior nationals led the world rankings in 2015.\\nThe world has closed the gap, but Phelps remains the gold standard.')]"

       "  'There is a second critical contest in America’s 2016 elections: the battle for control of the Senate.\\nRepublicans, pessimistic about their presidential prospects, feel an urgency to hold on to the Senate, where they now effectively have a 54-to-46 advantage. (Democrats would have to score a net gain of 30 seats to win a majority in the House, a highly unlikely prospect.) Both parties acknowledge that the Senate is a tossup that will be affected by the presidential election. But there are two other, perhaps more important, factors: the outcome of a number of remaining primaries and the question of whether congressional Republicans, especially the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, can fashion an agenda that, if necessary, creates a distance from the debates of the presidential race.\\nStrategists on both sides suggest that there are two Republican-held seats that lean Democratic, along with several tossups. There is only one Democratic-held seat, that of the party’s Senate leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring, that seems competitive. But there are three or four other Republican-held seats that may be vulnerable if the presidential race proves a landslide for the Democrats.\\nDemocrats, however, say that a couple of primaries will be critical: In Pennsylvania, party leaders believe that if Katie McGinty, an environmentalist, can emerge the winner in her close contest next week, she has a chance to unseat Senator Patrick J. Toomey, the incumbent Republican, in November. Later, if Representative Patrick Murphy, a Florida Democrat, is able to defeat a challenger from the left who faces ethics charges, he will be the favorite to take the seat vacated by Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican.\\nOn the Republican side, the issue is the extent of the damage that a few challengers from the right will be able to inflict on more mainstream candidates. An example: The party has felt confident about Nevada since it settled on Joe Heck, a popular House member, as its candidate. This month, however, Sharron Angle, a prominent Tea Party activist, jumped into the race. Ms. Angle won a multicandidate primary in 2010 but lost to Mr. Reid after asserting that Shariah was spreading, as well as making other claims that voters appeared to find dubious. She is not likely to win this time but could damage Mr. Heck.\\nDemocrats believe that the refusal of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to allow a hearing on President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, will hurt Republican incumbents in states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Ohio. “They try to stress their independence,” notes J. B. Poersch, a top Democratic political strategist, “but they’re carrying McConnell’s baggage.” Republicans counter that these races are local contests and that their stronger incumbents will prevail in Ohio and elsewhere. Ironically, one of the Republicans’ models is a Democrat, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who was elected to the Senate in 2012 despite Mr. Obama’s losing her state by almost 20 points.\\nMr. Ryan, who again took himself out of consideration for a presidential run last week, has a different take, however. He thinks that it is important for congressional Republicans to frame a message — and policy prescriptions — that could separate them from an unpopular presidential candidate.\\nThat approach has appeal, but it has problems, too. For one, the speaker, a Jack Kemp protégé, is out of sync with the angry Republican rank and file this year on issues like immigration and trade.\\nAlso, separation is not easy. Former Representative Tom Davis of Virginia, a leading Republican strategist who used to oversee the House campaign committee, knows what it is like to be saddled with a liability. In 1994, he won election to a suburban Washington district while Oliver North, a right-leaning former Marine who had been embroiled in the Iran-contra scandal, was blowing a race for the Senate.\\nBut Mr. Davis worries that Republican candidates will find it tougher to overcome such liabilities this time, particularly if Donald J. Trump leads the ticket: “He just has offended too many people not to affect other races.”'),\n",

       "  'On April 1, police officers from the 108th Precinct were called to an address in Woodside, Queens, by a man named August Watkins. He reported that his car had been stolen. The timing of his call would become an issue in the days that followed.\\nThat precinct was one of five in Queens and another in Brooklyn that were in the midst of a wave of commercial robberies. The crimes had begun six days earlier, on March 26, when someone robbed the N&K Smart Mart on Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights, Queens, at 6:40 a.m., the police said.\\nThe man who robbed the store said he had a gun under his jacket. “Give me money,” he demanded, leaving with $800, the police said.\\nSimilar scenes played out in gas stations, bodegas, dollar stores, Subway restaurants, a Dunkin’ Donuts and a smoke shop, sometimes as often as three times a day.\\nOne day, two robberies several blocks apart took place in a span of seven minutes in Sunnyside, Queens. Another day, a robber struck the same BP gas station twice, the police said.\\n“He came in and came around,” an employee who gave only his first name, Onur, said, recalling the robbery and pointing to the register. It was 1:58 a.m. on March 28. The robber walked out with $200, Onur said.\\nAlmost 12 hours later, at 1:25 p.m., after a shift change, the robber returned. “It’s the same story,” Onur said. “Same guy.” He did better the second time around, stealing $400, Onur said.\\nThe number of robberies rose to 16 over 10 days. Then, on April 7, the police announced that the crimes were linked. They had all been committed by the same man, the police said, identifying Mr. Watkins, who had reported his car stolen six days earlier, as the robber.\\nLast week, a woman who identified herself as Mr. Watkins’s former fiancée answered the door at her apartment in Woodside, his last known address and where he had reported his car stolen. Speaking through tears and on the condition that her name not be used, she said he had fallen on hard times, some of which he had brought on himself.\\nThey had met at a bar in Astoria, Queens, the woman said, when the friends she was with left to use the bathroom. Mr. Watkins, 42, approached and the two hit it off. He was a truck driver who worked for companies that held big events, transporting supplies, she said. He played handball with friends, and took her to movies and dinners in Manhattan and to the Queens waterfront. He had spent time in prison, for robbery and attempted robbery, but she and her family were convinced that life was behind him, and the couple were engaged to be married.\\nThen something changed.\\n“Heroin,” the woman said. “He started using a year ago.” He told her a friend gave him some and he had gotten hooked.\\n“It hurts,” she said. “I’d see him in pain here. He’d say, ‘I need it.’”\\nSix months after he slipped into addiction, she kicked him out. “It was like tough love,” she said. “He had to leave.”\\nMr. Watkins still came around from time to time to take a shower or to get a change of clothes. “He was living out of his car,” she said.\\nThat was the car he had reported stolen. He sat on the front stoop of the building in Woodside and answered the officers’ questions, his former fiancée said. It was around 1 p.m., she said, explaining why that was important: That very day, the crime wave had hit two gas stations in Queens, one nearby at 6:05 a.m. and the other miles away at 12:35 p.m. The officers’ visit, it is believed, was meant to provide Mr. Watkins with an alibi for at least the second crime on the day.\\nMr. Watkins was arrested on April 8 in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. His lawyer, Lowell J. Sidney, said last week that his client had been charged in only one robbery, at a Subway shop on April 3. The police said their investigation was continuing.\\nMr. Watkins’s former fiancée also said she found it unlikely, if not impossible, that on April 2, the day after he reported his car stolen, he had robbed two stores within seven minutes, as the police stated. But it was not impossible: Last week, maintaining a brisk pace and jaywalking, a reporter went from one location, a dollar store, to the other, a liquor store, in five minutes and 48 seconds.\\nEven Mr. Watkins’s supposed alibi has been cast in doubt. A reporter asked the police about the stolen car, and a spokesman for the department located the report. The time it was taken was recorded as 6 p.m., not 1.'),\n",

       "  'KHILAD, India — The cattle camp, on a dusty back road lined with thorny babul trees that seem to thrive no matter how weak the rains, is just about impossible to miss.\\nOn a recent day, nearly 3,000 impassive animals took shelter from the midday heat under makeshift tents. They munched the 30 pounds or so of hacked-up sugar cane and sorghum stalks they are allotted and lapped up all the water they wanted, a precious gift in this drought-stricken part of the country.\\nAfter a third consecutive deficient monsoon season, the government of the Beed district has established as a temporary measure 264 of these camps — long a fixture of drought relief efforts in Maharashtra State — after surveys predicted a shortage of fodder for the animals. But the camps, set up to handle thousands of cattle, have run into an unanticipated problem: The owners of the livestock, who were supposed to drop them off, have instead moved in — cooking utensils, spare cots, water drums and all.\\nThe hundreds of farmers packed into the camp do not always enjoy the same comforts as their cattle, which are considered sacred in Hinduism. Slaughtering cows is outlawed in most states, and preserving them is considered essential to avoiding a large-scale catastrophe.\\nThe farmers are forced to fend for themselves, cooking their own meals and living in tents surrounded by mounds of fodder, the ground nearby covered with fresh droppings. Nevertheless, they swore they would not return home until the rains came, whenever that might be.\\n“It gets very cold in the winters and in the mornings and evenings,” said Bhimabai Garje, 65, who moved three months ago from her home in Khilad. “It’s very hot during the day inside the tent. Mosquitoes bite us all night. But we have no choice.”\\nThe local authorities are aware of the squalid conditions, but say there is not much they can do.\\n“It was not our expectation,” said Naval Kishore Ram, the senior administrator for the Beed district. “We run the camp for the animals. If you start providing food for the human beings, the camp will take another form. This will be a camp for human beings. The basic objective will be disturbed.”\\nLast year in Beed, 45 waterless days stretched out grimly in the middle of what was supposed to be its prime rainy season, as drought was widespread in India. In Marathwada, a region in central Maharashtra State that includes Beed and seven other districts, rainfall was 40 percent below the norm.\\nWells and hand pumps have run dry, and rumors of mass migrations swirl. Politicians clash over how to address the crisis, and experts worry that the emergency relief, including the cattle camps and the tankers that deliver drinking water to villages, will never stem its root causes.\\nThe crisis extends well beyond the Beed district. In nearby Latur, the government sent drinking water by train to meet a surging need. Last month, thousands of farmers in Nashik, in Maharashtra, took to the streets to demand, among other things, compensation for lost crops. And on Wednesday, the Bombay High Court banned Indian Premier League cricket matches in the parched state starting in May in the hope of conserving water.\\nAjay Dandekar, a professor at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi who has studied the drought, said the conditions in Marathwada had resulted from dual calamities: a chronically arid landscape ravaged further by rising temperatures and El Niño, as well as the diversion of water to western Maharashtra, where most of its industry and thirsty sugar cane crops lie.\\n“The situation is very grave — it’s hopeless,” he said of the arid countryside.\\nMs. Garje felt the gravity of the situation last winter in Khilad. The cotton and sorghum monsoon crops had failed, and the village well was nearly dry. Tankers brought drinking water, but she worried about her three cattle, three buffalo and an ox that the family had bought, one by one, beginning 25 years ago when crop yields were bountiful.\\n“I saw the cattle of other villages dying,” she said.\\nSo at one January dawn, she and her husband set out for the cattle camp, nearly two miles away, walking across a bridge over a rocky ravine that was once a river, past the sorghum and cotton fields that had yielded so little last year. They foraged for wood to build their tents, and took dried cow dung from the neighbors for their roofs.\\nShe now cooks vegetables over an open fire, and returns home twice a month to check in on her son who looks over their fields. But she does not contemplate going back for good.\\n“I love my cattle more than my children,” she said. “I want to stay with them. The life of a farmer all depends on cattle.”\\nIt is a sentiment echoed by many residents of the camp, mostly men who have shifted with their animals, and are visited occasionally by their small children and wives.\\nBabasaheb Garje, 30, also of Khilad but no immediate relation to Ms. Garje, said that at the camp, at least, there was drinking water. His wife comes in the morning, helping him feed their cows and bringing food from home, then leaves in the evening.\\n“After she goes, I sit and think what will happen to the animals,” he said. “I think about the rainfall, and whether it will come this year.”\\nNot all cattle camps are bare-bones: A sprawling establishment in the Beed district village of Palwan supplies meals for the farmers staying there and is trying to address one symptom of their distress — their inability to pay for their children’s weddings. The camp organizers are planning a joint marriage ceremony this month for 50 couples of drought-affected farmers, including 14 couples whose families stay in the camp.\\nThe program is being financed by the nongovernmental organization that runs the camp. Rajendra Maske, its secretary, is also a member of the Shiv Sangram Party, which stood for state elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. Camp residents say the government has awarded the contracts for many of the camps to NGOs run by political workers.\\nIn a starched cotton shirt and crisp trousers, Mr. Maske surveyed the camp with evident satisfaction. He said he hoped the chief minister of Maharashtra would come for the marriage ceremony, and that at $30,000 for the whole affair the NGO was sparing no expense.\\n“People have an emotional connection to the camp,” Mr. Maske said.\\nIn February, with some postmonsoon crops showing promise, Mr. Ram, the Beed administrative official, recommended closing the camps “for a month or two.” The government agreed, but the outcry from farmers and politicians was swift, and officials relented.\\nSanjay Malani, the executive editor of a small daily newspaper in Beed, said that the government was caving to political pressure, and that the camps were being used as vote banks for political parties.\\n“It’s a moneymaking and image-making business,” Mr. Malani said.\\nThe relative lavishness of the Palwan camp is atypical, however. The Khalid camp, which is run by the NGO of Vijay Golhar, a Bharatiya Janata Party member and a former member of the district assembly, appeared more austere.\\n“My father has always been working for the betterment and development of the farmers,” said his daughter, Ratnaprabha Golhar. She said that the NGO was providing for all the farmers’ needs, and that any critique of the camp might have come from “some opposition.”\\nBut Suresh Wanve, 34, who tends 20 cows and buffalo with his brother at the camp in Khilad, said he would prefer that farmers receive the money the government is spending on the animals’ fodder in cash, so they could buy fodder themselves and stay in their homes.\\nStill, he felt compelled to stay with the animals, whom he likened to the goddess Lakshmi, or the Hindu goddess of wealth. He worries about thieves now that his wife stays alone with their children.\\n“We know all these things,” he said, “but we don’t have any other options.”'),\n",

There are the taunts, and the peltings of dirt and rocks they may face as they climb down the hill.\\nAnd if they make it into the water, they risk confrontation with a band of residents, known widely as the Bay Boys, who have long been accused of zealously — and sometimes violently — claiming the epic waves here as their exclusive territory.\\n“The last time I surfed out there, these guys tried to really hurt me,” said Chris Taloa, 42, who for years lived in nearby Redondo Beach. “A guy tried to ram a board into my ribs.”\\nBut after intimidation that has kept outsiders like Mr. Taloa away for generations, a group of surfers is fighting to open up the beach to all comers. A class-action lawsuit filed last month by the Coastal Protection Rangers and two surfers seeks to bar the Bay Boys from congregating at Lunada Bay — similar to the way injunctions have been used against members of criminal street gangs.\\nThe alleged members hail from one of the most exclusive communities in Southern California; many of them are middle-aged; some live in multimillion-dollar homes so close to the coastline here that the morning fog rolling off the ocean leaves their lawns damp.\\nStill, Vic Otten, one of the lawyers for those bringing the lawsuit, said the group represented a threat to the public. Only eight members have been named in the lawsuit so far, but he said he expected to add dozens more.\\n“They’ve taken a public asset, the ocean, and stolen it through violence and intimidation,” he said. “In California, the ocean belongs to the public, not to a bunch of trust-fund babies.”\\nOutside his auto shop, where surfboards were leaning against the wall, Angelo Ferrara, who, along with several of his family members, was named in the lawsuit, said that his family was not part of any gang, and that the territorialism here was no worse than anywhere else.\\n“Surfing is overcrowded,” Mr. Ferrara, 58, said. “You have beginners, intermediate and advanced. And they don’t get along.”\\nFrank Ponce, a Palos Verdes resident and surfer, scoffed at the idea of an organized gang, saying the problem was merely “a couple bad apples,” and visitors who were not experienced enough to surf a wave as powerful as those at Lunada Bay.\\n“You get all these people from out of town who think they’re big-wave surfers, and then they cut people off,” Mr. Ponce said. “Of course they’re going to get yelled at — they’re endangering lives.”\\nSurfing “localism,” with a hierarchy in the water based on skill and seniority, is hardly exclusive to this beach: It can be found at choice breaks from here to Australia. And many surfers see its benefits, especially in spots with big waves that are dangerous for beginners.\\nAs surfing’s popularity has exploded in recent years, localism has faded as more people have charged the waves.\\nBut not at Lunada Bay, which offers not only some of the most powerful waves in Southern California, but also an easily defensible location. At the edge of the Palos Verdes Peninsula south of Los Angeles, it is a long drive from most population centers; the steep path down from the cliffs to the ocean is treacherous even when nothing is being thrown at you; and the police department in this town — where the median family income is more than $170,000 and Porsches are a common sight — has long been accused of tacitly supporting the Bay Boys’ local-only ethos, as a strategy for keeping away crowds.\\nMr. Taloa grew up surfing on the north shore of Oahu, in Hawaii, an area famous for its huge waves — and for locals who will use their fists to enforce their hierarchy in the water. But Mr. Taloa said he had never faced anything like what goes on in Lunada Bay, where the harassment began before he even reached the water.\\n“In most places, if you come out in the lineup, wait your turn, give respect, they’ll give you a chance, but these guys don’t even do that,” he said. In Lunada, he said, “I’ve been threatened with jail and rape, racial language.”\\nDiana Milena Reed, an aspiring big-wave surfer who lives in Malibu, said she was sexually harassed in February while watching a friend surf from a stone patio that local surfers constructed decades ago on the nearby rocks — without approval from the state. She said a middle-aged man sprayed beer on her, made an array of sexual comments, and briefly exposed himself, all while several others looked on.\\n“There aren’t usually a lot of women out there,” Ms. Reed, 29, said. “That’s intimidating enough, without having men harass you.”\\nMs. Reed is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, which also seeks to compel the city to crack down. Past pledges to stamp out the group were quickly abandoned. Little changed here after a brawl on the beach in 1995, surfers said. And in 2002, when the police chief installed a camera to record Lunada Bay full time, the City Council soon ordered it removed, after residents complained that it would draw untold masses to the area after they got a peek at Palos Verdes’s natural splendor.\\n“Palos Verdes would like nothing better than to have gates at either end of the peninsula, and not let any of us up there,” said Matt Warshaw, who edits the Encyclopedia of Surfing website. Even growing up in nearby Manhattan Beach in the 1970s, he said, he knew that going to Palos Verdes would mean trouble.\\nAfter the release of an undercover video last summer — which was produced by The Guardian and showed middle-aged men harassing would-be surfers, and the police doing little in response to a complaint — the police chief, Jeff Kepley, vowed to end localism.\\nIn a brief telephone interview, Chief Kepley said he could not discuss the issue because of the lawsuit, but added: “We’ve done a lot. All anyone says is that we don’t do anything.”\\nStill, reports of harassment have continued. And most outsiders continue to stay away. On a recent day with a big swell, only three men were in the water at Lunada Bay, catching wave after majestic wave. A few others watched from the stone porch, where beer, snacks and surf equipment were stashed.\\n“Nobody goes there, because the reputation is so well known throughout the surf world,” said Steve Hawk, a Southern California native and the former editor of Surfer Magazine. “They’ve kind of succeeded.”')]"
